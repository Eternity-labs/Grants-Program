# W3F Grant Proposal
* **Project Name:** Eternity Network
* **Team Name:** Eternity labs
* **Payment Address:** BTC 1LYvQuzdyvy3KpkKxLK54SC3Mki3kSAtM7

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

The Eternity Network is building a "decentralized quantization protocol" based on the Substrate3.0 Framework. The protocol will provide basic simple quantitative services for crypto users of the blockchain. The Eternity labs team wants to use it as infrastructure for the quantified block of blockchain.

### Overview

Quantitative transactions on blockchain usually require high network requirements, which means it is difficult to complete them on the chain. Solidity is tricky to deal with. Usually in the quantitative scenario, the centralized quantitative service providers generally provide quantitative services, but it is difficult to ensure that the centralized service providers do not embezzle user funds, nodes do evil and other problems. For ordinary users of encryption, it is likely that they do not have the professional quantitative knowledge and make the wrong decision in the transaction
So irreparable damage was done

### Birth of the Eternity Network

The Eternity Network exists to solve the quantitative problem of cryptocurrencies. The base layer of the Eternity Network was built by Eternity labs using Substrate 3.0. It will provide a complete, decentralized, quantified service infrastructure that supports mainstream chains. Node operators of blockchain, DApp developers, quants, data modelers, and DApp users all have access to the decentralized quant Protocol infrastructure on the Eternity Network. We want to greatly simplify the threshold for quantifying user engagement. The Eternity Network will serve as polkadot's Parachain.

### Project Details

The Eternity Network is composed of Eternity Node,Eternity Model Contract,Decentralized API and Eternity SDK.
* The Eternity node is a node network composed of Substrate 3.0. The nodes contain the necessary Quant Pallets and Model Pallets to verify whether the models under the chain are reliable and secure. The model quantization data can be uploaded to the IPFS network.
* The Eternity Model Contract is a smart Contract on the front end of a DApp that is responsible for quantifying the flow of money in and out. Users only need a Dapp wallet to easily enjoy quantified services. Node operators are also rewarded for providing quantified services. Users can only get ecosystem tokens by quantifying them.
* The Decentralized API is a separate sector of the quantization market. In V1.0, developers are able to explore the crypto market with the API. In V2.0, users are able to be Decentralized based on Eternity Network publishes its own quantification program, and users can choose the right developers to provide quantification services according to their needs.
* The Eternity SDK makes the use of the Eternity Network much simpler. Dapp developers can integrate this SDK into their applications, such as the development of quantitative models.

For more details, see our hackathon [documentation](https://github.com/ParityAsia/hackathon-2021-summer/tree/main/teams/04-EternityLabs/docs).

### Substrate/Polkadot Integration
The Eternity Network can run as a parallchain to the Polkadot. It can also operate as a Polkadot independent chain. The whole network is built on the substrate 3.0 Framework, and OCW(Off-chain Work) will serve as the adaptation quantization model API for users. All contracts support Ink! and Solidity. Eternity Model Contract will be applied to polkadot.js.



### Ecosystem Fit

The Eternity Network offers a more complete set of quantification programs than the Pionex. Thanks to Substrate 3.0 and OCW, it will be provided in a decentralized manner. In the future, Eternity Network will serve as a decentralized infrastructure for quantifying services.
